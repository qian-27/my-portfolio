    title: "Bluetooth Scanning IoT Device",
    description: "I developed this ESP32-based device for my IoT course that scans nearby Bluetooth signals and outputs changes through both an LCD display and Morse code audio. When I press the button, the device scans for nearby Bluetooth devices, displays the results on the LCD, and the speaker communicates any differences from the last scan in Morse code. This project was a fantastic hands-on experience that taught me embedded systems programming and hardware integration. Working on this really strengthened my teamwork and communication skills as we collaborated to bring hardware and software together.",
