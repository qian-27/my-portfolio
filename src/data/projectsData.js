    description: [
      "During the IoT course, I gained valuable hands-on experience working with embedded systems. My teammate and I designed a Bluetooth scanning device that activates when the user clicks a button. Once triggered, the ESP32 scans for Bluetooth devices in the surrounding environment and displays the results on an LCD screen. Additionally, a speaker with an amplifier announces the results in Morse code.",
      "This project provided an excellent hands-on experience that taught me embedded systems programming and IoT fundamentals. It also strengthened my teamwork and communication skills as we collaborated to integrate both hardware and software components."

    title: "AI 3D Model Generator Workflow",
    description: "I developed a local, cost-free workflow for generating 3D assets for VR applications using ComfyUI and Tencent Hunyuan 3D, allowing me to quickly turn ideas into models. The process starts with a simple visual prompt or hand-drawn sketch, which is converted into a 3D model through an AI-driven pipeline. The generated assets can then be refined in Blender or imported directly into Unity for testing. This workflow enables fast experimentation, efficient iteration, and creative exploration, helping me quickly evaluate concepts and streamline the early stages of VR development.",
