    description: [
      "During the IoT course, I gained valuable hands-on experience working with embedded systems. My teammate and I designed a Bluetooth scanning device that activates when the user clicks a button. Once triggered, the ESP32 scans for Bluetooth devices in the surrounding environment and displays the results on an LCD screen. Additionally, a speaker with an amplifier announces the results in Morse code.",
      "This project provided an excellent hands-on experience that taught me embedded systems programming and IoT fundamentals. It also strengthened my teamwork and communication skills as we collaborated to integrate both hardware and software components."
